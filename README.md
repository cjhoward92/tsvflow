# TypeScript vs Flow

This is a repo containing information from my TypeScript vs Flow talk at Phoenix TypeScript!

See the `flow-app` and `ts-app` folders for the example projects

## Pros of TypeScript

 - Fast compile
 - Compile required to generate JavaScript
 - Better community support
 - Great support in VS Code
 - Flexible config
 - You can't just "turn it off" (well, sort of...)

## Cons of TypeScript

 - Require `.ts` extension (prolly a pro)
 - Requires a config
 - Can't handle compose functions
 - Does not have strict object types
